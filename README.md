### Hello there! 


-  I'm currently working on finishing my Information Systems degree at The Ohio State University, I'm taking Business Developement courses and Software Developement courses.
-  Iâ€™m currently learning about Data and am currently partaking in the DataCamp Data science courses to increase my knowledge of the fundamentals of Data Engineering.
-  I'm also interning at a SaaS Facilities Management ERP Company called FMX and am currently a Data Specialist, I also work with the engineering team to write scripts for automated ETL processes.
-  When I'm not working or learning, I love video games! My favorites right now are Helldivers 2, Rocket League, and Halo! I also like to design and 3D print things! I'm also probably one of the biggest Star Wars fans you'll meet.


Thanks for checking out my GitHub and May The Force Be With You!
