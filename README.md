### Hello there! 


-  I'm a current data analyst looking for an oppurtinity to learn and grow, I have a Bachelors of Science in Business Administration with a specialization in Information Systems from The Ohio State University. 
-  Iâ€™m always learning about new data practices and my most recent experience was as a Data Analyst at a Health and Bellbeing company called HealthWorks.
-  When I'm not working or learning, I love video games! My favorites right now are Helldivers 2, Rocket League, and Halo! I also like to design and 3D print things! I'm also probably one of the biggest Star Wars fans you'll meet.
